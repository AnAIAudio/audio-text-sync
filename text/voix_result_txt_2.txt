Welcome to Films and Stars, your insider's guide to the movies.
This week, we record the cinematic milestones Naomi Watts has logged in her career.
But for now, let's chat with her co-stars at the premiere of The Friend.
Louise, I need to talk with you.
It's about the dog.
(whines) I wanted to ask if you could take him?
(laughs) No, I- I- I can't.
N- no.
This is what Walter wanted after he died.
Why would he say that?
You were his best friend.
Well, that's kind of hard to say no to, even if it means you'll now share your life with a Great Dane, one of the biggest dog breeds in the world.
The Friend is a comedy drama that deals with themes like love, friendship, grief, and healing.
At the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, the cast members, including legendary actor Bill Murray, were open about how they deal with grief in their own lives.
You know, when...
as life goes on, you will find that deep loss creates moments of humor.
Yeah.
Great...
uh, the greater the loss- You have to.
...
the deeper the moments of humor.
Like, I...
probably the funniest time I ever had was my nine brothers and sisters in a, in a limousine at my father's funeral.
It was some of the funniest stuff I ever experienced in my whole life.
We laughed so.
We laughed so hard at people that were looking in the car going, "Oh, they must be so sad," and we were screaming with laughter.
Aw.
So you gotta do it to, you gotta do it to- Find ways.
You gotta do it.
It's a, it's a part of a...
it's a phenomenon.
How's the book going?
There's considerable interest and we've gotta capitalize on it now.
I just can't keep having him here.
He's taken over my bed and he's getting in the way of my work.
I don't think it's about the dog.
He's in mourning.
He lost his master.
How would you feel?
I think, unfortunately for everyone experiencing grief, you know, it's, it's, it's gonna happen if it hasn't yet.
Um, and there's certainly, you know, relationships in my life that, that, um, yeah, people that I really miss.
Um, so I think it's, it's always, uh, a beautiful thing, even if it's difficult to sort of be able to personally reflec- reflect on the things that a character, a fictional character is going through.
And yeah, I was, I was just so grateful every day to be on a set that felt so caring, not only about the film that we were making, but of each other.
Um, it felt like we sort of made this little family and it was very involved in telling the story, um, in...
with the vision that, that we set out to do.
If Walter were here, what would you like to say to him?
I wanna tell him that no matter how much I sleep, I'm exhausted, that I feel as though I'm losing control.
Remove the dog.
I'll sit here too.
Next to Naomi Watts, the biggest star of the film is the Great Dane, played by Bing.
Finding this special dog was quite a journey.
We looked for a year and a half.
I checked out probably 50 dogs.
None of them I thought could do it, and then when we were introduced to Bev and Bing, and she comes from, uh, Iowa.
And when I met them I said to the filmmakers, the director said, "If we don't hire this dog, I'm not doing the film." So we brought them to New York.
I started teaching them how to do, um, movie behaviors because it's a whole different set of hand signals than what you do in basic obedience.
Um, and the key to the success with this film is that Naomi Watts, who is so lovely, worked with us for a month.
We went to her house three times a week and she trained him like we trained him.
So by the time he got to the set, he was in love with her and she could handle him.
So what, what you see on film is really what was in real life and it's unlike anything I've ever seen or ever done, so...
Someone else who was very happy with having Naomi on board was Director Scott McGehee.
Finding Naomi, I mean, she was such a kind of...
Like, she embodies a kind of tender, delicate vulnerability, but she also has a great sense of humor and she loves animals.
She was sort of the linchpin that kind of made it all come together.
If you're looking for a fun movie that will have you both laughing and maybe shedding a tear or two, then make sure to check out The Friend.
I could feel him missing Walter in the same way I did.
The dog provides essential emotional support.
I guess I saw it the other way around, like I'm the emotional support human and it's the dog that can't cope.
What?
Many people don't know that acclaimed actress Naomi Watts is actually British, even though she started her career in Australia, often competing for parts with her good pal and fellow future star, Nicole Kidman.
I was born in England and I lived there for 14 years, and then I spent 10 years in Australia.
I've since, um, lived in America for almost 20.
Um, does that add up?
No.
(laughs) (laughs) Okay.
16 years then.
After finding success down under, Naomi headed to LA, but years of toiling away in small parts followed, until she landed her big break in the 1999 cult classic Mulholland Drive.
I think of my career as pre Mulholland Drive and post Mulholland Drive.
Another early hit for the blonde beauty saw her battling a violent home invasion in the dark thriller Funny Games.
Yeah, it was definitely, uh, more fun to play this than perhaps it is to view it.
Um, it's not, um, gonna be everyone's cup of tea, obviously.
It's a, it's a difficult and disturbing film and it requires work.
It's, it's not your average date movie.
In 2010, Watts hit the prestigious Cannes Film Festival to premiere the Woody Allen comedy drama You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, back before the director was quite so controversial.
You don't even go to your trailer.
It's too much fun on the set with Woody, you know, breaks (laughs) in between each shot.
Also screening at Cannes that year was her political thriller Fair Game, in which Naomi portrayed an undercover CIA agent whose identity gets leaked to the press.
Director Doug Liman sent his star to an intense boot camp that actual agents go through.I think on the first day, I, I...
as he sort of kicked me in the shins and threw me down, I, I said, "Ow," as you do.
And, um, and they were like, "None of that." You know?
They didn't like- They specifically said, "You can't-" No.
They said, "Don't say ow unless you need to go to the hospital." Yeah, exactly.
(laughs) That's exactly what they said.
And, by the way, I, I mean, it was a fascinating two-day period.
I mean, how many people can say they, um, they have breastfed while packed with a weapon?
(laughs) (laughs) Then in 2012 came another very physical role in the disaster flick, The Impossible.
As a mother trying to keep her family alive through a tsunami, Watts faced quite a struggle.
On top of the acting pain, yes, there's the feeling pain and, and, um, in the water.
All that stuff was very, very difficult on the body.
(laughs) The movie earned the star Best Actress nominations from both the Oscars and the Golden Globes.
Not that winning a trophy would carry much weight with Naomi's kids back home.
No.
I mean, I don't think they're interested.
They...
the TV will probably be on in the house, but, um, they'd be more interested in Wreck-It Ralph, I think.
Over the years, the versatile star has entertained us in everything from comedies like St.
Vincent to the horror flick Goodnight Mommy, from the thriller The Desperate Hour to the intimate drama The Friend.
I, I just find those stories worth telling, and they're usually difficult subjects for everyone to talk about.
And if it can spark up a conversation that can be considered, you know, a way for them to understand something better or, um, a breakthrough even, then, then great.
I feel like I'm doing my job, which is hopefully in service of, of, of people reflecting, you know, seeing themselves in, in a story.
The beautiful and talented Naomi Watts is sure to keep amazing us with her stellar performances for years to come, as she just keeps getting better with age.
Trust your instinct, you know, and stop trying to please everyone and compare yourself to everyone else.
You know, that takes years of experience to get beyond that.
Some, some are blessed with that.
I'm still working on it.
But, um, I do feel proud of my cumulative years of experience, and they do mean and add up to something.
Um, so for me, it's about embracing this time now.
So what's your deal?
My deal?
I'm just a regular guy with a regular job, but I've got this condition where I don't feel pain.
Hey, there we go.
Oh my God, you're a superhero.
(laughs) Well, not exactly a superhero, but rising star Jack Quaid will tell us more about his role as Nathan Kane, the leading character of the new action flick Novacaine.
Nathan is, uh, he's a big nerd, um, which I love about him.
Uh, he's a extremely nice guy, and, um, he's a bit lonely.
Um, he's found that he hasn't really connected with anyone romantically in his life ever.
And, you know, he's getting towards, uh, you know, early 30s, late 20s, and, um, you know, he's realizing that he never really quite found that special someone.
Enter Sherry, played by Amber Midthunder.
You know, he works in a bank, and there's a girl he likes at the bank, um, which is Sherry.
And, you know, they have this kind of encounter, I guess, which they, I think kind of brings both of them to life in a different way.
And, you know, then the bank gets robbed.
And so he's sent on this journey of confronting his fears, and, and she's sent on this opposite journey of her kind of trying to push away, I think, all of her guilt and her fears and her trauma.
And it's filled with action and fun.
Oh my God, what am I doing?
I just wanna know where Sherry is.
You ever fired a gun before?
Go.
What makes this movie and Nate's superpower unique is that it's not necessarily a superpower.
It's very human, and I think that's a very new take on superhero movies.
And I think the superhero thing is very turned on its head with this movie.
What I love about it is that he's not a great fighter.
He doesn't really know how to fight, but he can get his butt kicked and get up every single time, no matter how many punches they throw at him.
No matter how hard they punch him, he doesn't feel it.
So he gets up every single time.
And I love playing Nathan for that reason.
I love the fact that he's an unlikely action hero.
Uh, he's not the guy dealing out the punches.
He's the guy getting hit.
And I think that's such a cool, different, you know, uh, vibe.
Heads up!
Oh, sorry.
It's fine.
Yeah.
The scope of the action scenes, again, are very not superhero movie-esque.
They're very, like, normal human type of fights, but it's very crazy.
A lot of fighting, a lot of getting beat up, especially for Nate.
Uh, Roscoe gets hit in the head, but I think that's probably the extent of hi- of his pain.
What happened to your face?
You should see the other guy.
I'm really excited for audiences to see the very specific tone that we're going for with this.
Uh, I love that Nate is a very positive character, ultimately.
Uh, I like that he's, in a way, happy-go-lucky, uh, despite all of the horrific stuff that happens to him.
It's going to be a wild ride, and, uh, I'm just excited to hear the reactions in the theater.
Because obviously, like, hopefully there'll be laughter and all that, but it's also gonna be coupled with, like, screaming and whatever this noise is.
Ah!
And, uh, that's what I hope people do.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Make sure to catch the story of an unlikely hero in- Novacaine, it is you.
(laughs) I thought you'd be dead by now.
Well, I'm not.
It's Novacaine.
(laughs) He's not dead.Coming up in Films and Stars, we count the cash and crown the kings of the big screen, and revisit an impactful musical event in One to One: John and Yoko.
Do you know where you are?
Where are we?
We're back in the jungle, baby!
It looks like action comedy fans might one day get to return yet again to the world of Jumanji, and Jack Black is planning to be there for it.
In a recent interview promoting his latest release, A Minecraft Movie, the hilarious actor was asked about potential follow-ups to some of his most beloved roles and gave status updates on them.
First up was the Jumanji series, which first kicked off back in the '90s, headlined by the late Robin Williams and a very young Kirsten Dunst, then was revived for two chapters, titled Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Jumanji: The Next Level, in 2017 and 2019 respectively, starring Black alongside Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan.
Now, Jack says a fourth outing is in the works.
He thinks it's highly likely it will be made, and if it does, he will definitely be in it.
His news on other potential sequels was less rosy, however.
Regarding a possible School of Rock 2, Black admitted it seems unlikely, though he has heard rumors of a spinoff called School of Rap, and hopes to make a cameo in that if it occurs.
Finally, asked about his beloved rom-com The Holiday with Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Cameron Diaz, Jack declared that he wishes that were in the works, and laughingly told Winslet to call him so they could make it happen.
Another weekend, another list of the highest-grossing blockbusters currently showing in cinemas.
We bring you the Box Office Top Five Countdown.
Ridley?
Are you okay?
It kind of felt like it was showing me something.
I get this feeling I don't think we're supposed to be here.
At number five, we take a genre-blending ride through fantasy, satire, and the strange power of belief in Death of a Unicorn.
A father and daughter accidentally hit a unicorn with their car, setting off a surreal chain of events involving corporate greed and mystical secrets.
Is there something in your car?
I don't think that we're supposed to have this.
We need to study it.
Whatever it is, it seems to be the cure for cancer?
Mommy?
Hmm?
Are you gonna have a good day today or a bad day?
I just feel so sorry.
Now that Daddy's dead, are we still gonna live here?
You know what?
I don't know.
On the fourth spot, one family's psyche is incredibly tested by The Woman in the Yard.
Hey, Mom.
There's a woman in the yard.
This mysterious tale centers on a widow whose life, and that of her two kids, is turned on its head after a peculiar, veil-covered female figure dressed all in black suddenly appears on their lawn and starts delivering spine-chilling warnings.
Daddy will know what to do.
All right.
Hello?
Mama, I think she's closer.
Today's the day.
This was my father's kingdom, a place of fairness.
But the queen changed everything.
In third place, a classic story gets a bold, enchanting revival for a new generation in Snow White.
Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?
Despite the controversy surrounding it, this Disney live action re-imagining of the iconic fairytale sees a fresh, empowered Snow White embark on a magical journey of self-discovery, friendship, and courage.
My parents always said this forest was a magical place.
Hello?
Is there anybody here?
(singing) Wait, wait.
It's a human.
What did you think I was?
A ghost.
When my wife passed and I left the Royal Marines, a lot of people would have given up on me.
You gave me a job.
You were patient with me.
You, Carla, Jenny, you're my family.
Giving up the gold medal to settle for the silver is A Working Man.
A retired Marine is minding his own business making a living through construction work until a bunch of criminals kidnap his boss' daughter, forcing him to unleash his lethal side to rescue her.
The police don't have the resources to work these cases.
They take a report and forget about it.
Please, find our daughter.
You killed your way into this.
You're gonna have to kill your way out of it.
Feel this much?
In the overworld- Whoa.
...
anything you can dream about, you can create.
So they built all this?
Ha.
Yeah, most of it.
Hola.And bringing plenty of action, humor, and pixelated peril to the top of the box office this week is A Minecraft Movie.
A place with no joy or creativity at all.
You, what are you making?
Oh, oh.
If they get their way- (screaming)...
this beautiful world and everything in it will wither and die.
Welcome this, means goodbye brother.
No it doesn't.
Don't look at her, it does.
Oh my gosh, I'm so soaked.
Ahh!
This place makes no sense.
(baby cooing) Let's do this.
You want me to fight the chicken?
Chicken jockey.
(roar) Oh, no not again.
Oh my God, oh my God.
Are you all right?
Your head is huge.
Daisy Edgar-Jones has become a familiar face in Hollywood, not just for her own incredible talents, but because the actress has starred alongside so many of the industry's biggest heartthrobs.
During a recent interview promoting her new movie, On Swift Horses, Edgar-Jones joked about sharing the screen with "the internet's boyfriends," having worked in the past few years with the likes of Paul Mescal, Harris Dickinson, Andrew Garfield, Sebastian Stan, Glen Powell, and now Jacob Elordi in her latest project.
However, the British beauty, who first gained widespread attention for her role in the sexy TV show Normal People alongside Mescal, highlighted the collaborative spirit of her good-looking male counterparts, praising their focus on serving the story rather than themselves.
And adding that they were one and all fully supportive of the fact that she was the one getting top billing, which, she laughs, is actually somewhat rare in an industry often dominated by huge egos.
Looking ahead, Daisy's excited for her upcoming movie Voyagers where she'll reunite with Garfield, and laughs that there are only Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler left for her to work with to complete her collection of all the hottest co-stars.
Did you tell him John Lennon called?
Oh, yeah.
And, and- Oh, and.
Yeah.
Well, you remember The Beatles?
That's right, yeah.
The new documentary 1:1 John & Yoko takes us back to 1972 New York and inside a pivotal moment in the lives of John Lennon and Yoko Ono.
Against the backdrop of a turbulent era, the film centers on the couple's famous One-to-One charity concert held to support special-needs children.
Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Kevin Macdonald, the new movie features previously unseen images, intimate home movies, and beautifully restored footage, offering a rare glimpse into their music, activism, and personal world.
But this is kind of the period, the hangover from The Beatles, I suppose you could say.
This is like they've, John has just left the biggest band that ever were.
He's one of the most famous people in the world.
He's being hounded by the British press.
Yoko's being blamed, maybe a slightly racist way for the, for the, for, for, for, for the breakup of the band.
And they want to get out of Britain.
And so they're trying to start a new life, trying to find a new way to live, the new way to be celebrities.
They move into this tiny one-room flat.
He gives up his huge estate, you know, outside London in Windsor.
And living in this tiny, very modest way.
And so it's, uh, I guess a period of transformation.
It's a period of, like, how, somebody asking, "How do I become a different person?
How, I've left that Beatles persona behind, who am I now?" And here you see him kind of questing, I suppose.
I just got to see the village for the first time.
I really feel at home there.
The story we experienced in the documentary took place in the '70s, but Kevin discovered something very remarkable in terms of the current state of the world.
You can't help but, when you see something from 50 years ago, make those comparisons to today, can you?
And so it does help you understand today, and makes you think, "Oh, maybe we're less unique in the division in America and the politics is, is, is, is not as apocalyptic maybe because it's happened before and (laughs) things got better." And then maybe that's, maybe that's, there's some reassurance to be had from that.
But also, as I say, there's things like the attitudes towards race and attitudes towards environment that haven't really shifted that much in 50 years.
And which we're all congratulating ourselves on having these very progressive values and think, "Well, yes, but John and Yoko had those values 50 years ago." (laughs) And then they, it hasn't, hasn't changed very much.
I fell in love with an independent, creative genius.
I started waking up.
John Lennon is famous for his altruism, but that wasn't always the case.
Directing this documentary only emphasized for Kevin the kind of changes John made in his life.
I think that's the thing I find most appealing and attractive about him is that he is always thinking about, "What is the right thing to do?
How should I live my life?
What are the right attitudes to have?" And he's not ashamed of being wrong or sort of looking foolish.
He's not like most celebrities who are always just thinking about, "Oh, how do I look?
How do I, how does this, is this good for my image?" He's not, he's not interested in image at all.
He's the opposite of someone who's interested in image.
And I think that, um, that footage at the end of the film where you see him as the only man in the room at the first International Feminist Conference and the women are voting as to whether he should be thrown out of the room, I think is really extraordinary.
And it says a lot about his, he's very brave to do that actually.
And a lot of men would think, "Oh, I shouldn't be here." But then John's like, "Oh, I want to learn about this.
I want to learn about being a feminist." And in a way, implicitly he's acknowledging, "Um, I haven't been a feminist, I've been..." He was misogynistic.
He was sort of a difficult person, and he's trying to transform himself.
Experience the transformative journey of John Lennon and Yoko Ono amidst 1970s turmoil and activism in 1:1 John & Yoko.
I know someday, hey, you'll join us.
How would you like to be remembered?
Just as two lovers.
Next week in Films and Stars, we'll highlight Ben Affleck's invaluable contributions to the world of cinema.
Don't miss it.
