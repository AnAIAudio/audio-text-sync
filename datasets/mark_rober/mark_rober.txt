This is a pound of Jell-O, (gentle music) but this is 30,000 pounds of Jell-O.
And I made it 'cause ever since I was a kid, I've always wondered what it would look like to belly flop into the world's largest pool of Jell-O.
I started by digging a hole in my brother's backyard, but soon realized I needed a completely new way of making Jell-O for this to work, 'cause if I made it the normal way where you boil water on your stove, then mix in the powder, then refrigerate it for it to actually get firm, it would take 3,000 batches and three months to pull off.
So to scale things up, I took six 55-gallon drums with a custom welded spigot and a custom propane burner stand.
Then I filled each drum with water, gelatin powder, and red food coloring, and once it boiled, released it layer by layer into the pool every day for seven days.
Now, as for the refrigeration, I teamed up with Mother Nature, 'cause after studying the weather almanac for his city, I chose the exact three-week window in the year where the weather could cool the Jell-O to the perfect fridge temperature each night without freezing it.
It was so much freaking hard work to pull this off, but I was so stoked it finally worked, 'cause it turns out belly flopping on a Jell-O pool is actually way cooler than I'd always imagined.
